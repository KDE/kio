/**
 * @class KFileItemActions kfileitemactions.h <KFileItemActions>
 *
 * This class creates and handles the actions for a url (or urls) in a popupmenu.
 *
 * This includes:
 * @li "open with <application>" actions, but also
 * @li builtin services like mount/unmount for old-style device desktop files
 * @li user-defined actions for a .desktop file, defined in the file itself (see the desktop entry standard)
 * @li servicemenus actions, defined in .desktop files and selected based on the mimetype of the url
 *
 * KFileItemActions respects Kiosk-based restrictions (see the KAuthorized
 * namespace in the KConfig framework).  In particular, the "action/openwith"
 * action is checked when determining actions for opening files (see
 * addOpenWithActionsTo()) and service-specific actions are checked before
 * adding service actions to a menu (see addServiceActionsTo()).
 *
 * For user-defined actions in a .desktop file, the "X-KDE-AuthorizeAction" key
 * can be used to determine which actions are checked before the user-defined
 * action is allowed.  The action is ignored if any of the listed actions are
 * not authorized.
 *
 * @since 4.3
