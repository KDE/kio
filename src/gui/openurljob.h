 * @brief OpenUrlJob finds out the right way to "open" a URL.
 * This includes finding out its MIME type, and then the associated application,
 * or running desktop files, executables, etc.
 * It also honours the "use this webbrowser for all http(s) URLs" setting.
 *
 * For the "Open With" dialog functionality to work, make sure to set
 * KIO::JobUiDelegate as the delegate for this job (in widgets applications).
 * @code
 *    // Since 5.98 use:
 *    job->setUiDelegate(KIO::createDefaultJobUiDelegate(KJobUiDelegate::AutoHandlingEnabled, window));
 *    // For older releases use:
 *    job->setUiDelegate(new KIO::JobUiDelegate(KJobUiDelegate::AutoHandlingEnabled, window));
 * @endcode

 * @since 5.71
