/**
 * @class ApplicationLauncherJob applicationlauncherjob.h <KIO/ApplicationLauncherJob>
 *
 * @brief ApplicationLauncherJob runs an application and watches it while running.
 *
 * It creates a startup notification and finishes it on success or on error (for the taskbar).
 * It also emits an error message if necessary (e.g. "program not found").
 *
 * When passing multiple URLs to an application that doesn't support opening
 * multiple files, the application will be launched once for each URL.
 *
 * The job finishes when the application is successfully started. At that point you can
 * query the PID(s).
 *
 * For error handling, either connect to the result() signal, or for a simple messagebox on error,
 * you can use:
 * @code
 *    // Since 5.98 use:
 *    job->setUiDelegate(KIO::createDefaultJobUiDelegate(KJobUiDelegate::AutoHandlingEnabled, this));
 *    // For older releases use:
 *    job->setUiDelegate(new KIO::JobUiDelegate(KJobUiDelegate::AutoHandlingEnabled, this));
 * @endcode
 * Using JobUiDelegate (which is widgets based) also enables the feature of asking the user
 * in case the executable or desktop file isn't marked as executable. Otherwise the job will
 * just refuse executing such files.
 *
 * To invoke the open-with dialog (from KIOWidgets), construct an ApplicationLauncherJob without
 * any arguments or with a null KService.
 *
 * @since 5.69
