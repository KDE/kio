 *
 * \brief NameFinderJob finds a valid "New Folder" name.
 *
 * This job is useful when suggesting a new folder/file name, e.g. in KNewFileMenu,
 * the text box is pre-filled with a suggested name, typically in the form "New Folder";
 * to offer a valid name (i.e. one that doesn't already exist), you can use a NameFinderJob.
 *
 * Internally it uses a KIO::StatJob to determine if e.g. "New Folder" already exists,
 * and in such a case it will use KFileUtils::makeSuggestedName() to make a new name,
 * e.g. "New Folder (1)", then if the latter exists, KFileUtils::makeSuggestedName() will
 * be called again... etc, until it finds a name that doesn't already exist.
 *
 * Since NameFinderJob uses a KIO::StatJob, the code is asynchronous, which means it should
 * work for both local and remote filesystems without blocking I/O calls (this is important
 * when interacting with network mounts (e.g. SMB, NFS), from the upstream QFile perspective
 * these network mounts are "local" files even though they could actually reside on a server
 * halfway across the world).
 *
 * Note that KIO::StatJob will resolve URLs such as "desktop:/" to the most local URL, hence
 * it's advisable to always use baseUrl() (or finalUrl()) to get the actual URL.
 *
 * If the job fails for any reason targerUrl() will return an empty URL.
 *
 * \note You must call start() to start the job.
 *
 * \code
 *    // Create the job
 *    auto nameJob = new KIO::NameFinderJob(baseUrl, name, this);
 *    // Connect to the result() slot, and after making sure there were no errors call
 *    // finalUrl(), baseUrl() or finalName() to get the new url (base
 *    // url + suggested name), base url or suggested name, respectively
 *    connect(nameJob, &KJob::result, this, []() {
 *        if (!nameJob->error()) {
 *            const QUrl newBaseUrl = nameJob->baseUrl();
 *            const QUrl newName = nameJob->finalName();
 *            .....
 *            // Create the new dir "newName" in "newBaseUrl"
 *        }
 *    });
 *
 *    // Start the job
 *    nameJob->start();
 * \endcode
