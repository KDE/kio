/*! @mainpage File Selection Widgets

@section purpose Purpose

The KIOFileWidgets library provides the file selection dialog and its components.

@section desc Description

The file dialog is available to all kde applications by using the QFileDialog class.
The KDE QPA theme plugin uses a KFileDialog automatically.

The KIOFileWidgets library provides KFileWidget, which is the main widget in the file dialog, as well as
the KDirOperator widget which contains the file views, and other components of the file dialog.
Applications only need to link to KIOFileWidgets if they need direct access to KFileWidget
or KDirOperator or to the other widgets used by the file dialog, either in order to
modify the behavior of the file dialog, or to reuse its components into the application itself.
