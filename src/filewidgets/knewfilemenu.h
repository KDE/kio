 * @class KNewFileMenu knewfilemenu.h <KNewFileMenu>
 *
 * The 'Create New' submenu, for creating files using templates
 * (e.g.\ "new HTML file") and directories.
 *
 * The same instance can be used by both for the File menu and the RMB popup menu,
 * in a file manager. This is also used in the file dialog's RMB menu.
 *
 * To use this class, you need to connect aboutToShow() of the File menu
 * with slotCheckUpToDate() and to call slotCheckUpToDate() before showing
 * the RMB popupmenu.
 *
 * KNewFileMenu automatically updates the list of templates shown if installed templates
 * are added/updated/deleted.
 *
 * @author Bj√∂rn Ruberg <bjoern@ruberg-wegener.de>

 * @author David Faure <faure@kde.org>
 * Ideas and code for the new template handling mechanism ('link' desktop files)
