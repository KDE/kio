#~ "Internet server. This means that a web server can store information about "

#~ "consider this an invasion of privacy.</p><p>However, cookies are useful "
#~ "in certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet "
#~ "shops, so you can 'put things into a shopping basket'. Some sites require "
#~ "you have a browser that supports cookies.</p><p>Because most people want "
#~ "a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers "
#~ "you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. You might, for "
#~ "example want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server "
#~ "wants to set a cookie or simply reject or accept everything. For example, "
#~ "you might choose to accept all cookies from your favourite shopping web "
#~ "site. For this all you have to do is either browse to that particular "
#~ "site and when you are presented with the cookie dialogue box, click on "
#~ "<i> This domain </i> under the 'apply to' tab and choose accept or simply "
#~ "specify the name of the site in the <i> Domain Specific Policy </i> tab "
